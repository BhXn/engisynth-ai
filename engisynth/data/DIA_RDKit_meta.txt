Title: Drug Induced Autoimmunity Prediction data

Sources:
(a) Donated on 1 May 2025 to the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of molecular descriptors generated using RDKit, curated for the study of drug-induced autoimmunity via ensemble machine learning approaches. It’s organized into a training set and a testing set. These descriptors encode physicochemical and structural characteristics of drug molecules, with the aim of enabling predictive modeling for autoimmune risk assessment in drug candidates ([archive.ics.uci.edu][1]).
(b) Introductory paper: “InterDIA: Interpretable Prediction of Drug‑induced Autoimmunity through Ensemble Machine Learning Approaches” by Xiaojie Huang et al., published in *Toxicology* in 2025 ([archive.ics.uci.edu][1]).

Relevant information:
The dataset contains 477 instances and 195 features, all numerical descriptors derived from molecular structure. It has no missing values. It supports classification tasks in computational toxicology, providing a solid basis for developing interpretable machine learning models to predict drug-induced autoimmunity ([archive.ics.uci.edu][1]).

Data simulation:
Not applicable — the dataset is based on real molecular descriptor calculations using RDKit, not simulated data.

Class information:

1. class    DIA-positive drugs = 1, DIA-negative drugs = 0 (binary) ([archive.ics.uci.edu][1]).

Variable Information:
Here’s an excerpt inspired by the structure of your previous examples (full variables list would include 195 descriptors):

1. Label (target)    binary: 1 = DIA-positive, 0 = DIA-negative
2. SMILES ID         categorical: SMILES string identifier
3. BalabanJ          continuous feature, calculated descriptor
4. BertzCT           continuous feature, calculated descriptor
5. Chi0              continuous feature
6. Chi0n             continuous feature
7. Chi0v             continuous feature
8. Chi1              continuous feature
9. Chi1n             continuous feature
10. Chi1v            continuous feature
    ... (and so on, up to 195 molecular descriptor features) ([archive.ics.uci.edu][1]).
