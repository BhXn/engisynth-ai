Relevant information:
This dataset comprises clinical data from 319 individuals (though reported as 320 instances overall); among them, 161 were diagnosed with gallstone disease. It includes 38 real-valued features spanning demographic, bioimpedance, and laboratory measurements. The dataset has no missing values and is relatively balanced across disease status, making it suitable for machine learning tasks.

Data simulation:
Not applicable — this dataset contains real clinical measurements, not simulated data.
