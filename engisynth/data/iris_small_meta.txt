Relevant information:
This dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each species has exactly 50 samples. The dataset is balanced, has no missing values, and is widely used for demonstrating classification algorithms.

Data simulation:
Not applicable â€” this dataset contains real measurements collected from flowers.

Class information:
